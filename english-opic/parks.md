Last summer, I had a memorable experience at Nature Park.
My friend and I went for a picnic on a warm Saturday.
We didn't know there was a music festival that day.

As we ate, a group of performers in colorful costumes appeared and started juggling.
It was unexpected and fun to watch.
Later, we joined the crowd to see a band play live.
We danced and enjoyed the music.

It was a special day because of the surprise performance and the fun we had together. I'll always remember it.
