### Tell me about the kinds of parks that you like to visit. what do the park look like

I like visiting different kinds of parks.

My favorite is nature parks.
These parks have lots of trees, plants, and animals.
There are trails to walk on and sometimes rivers.
It's very quiet, and I can relax there.

I also enjoy parks in the city. These parks have gardens, playgrounds, and open spaces.
People go there to play sports, have picnics, or just relax.
There are paths to walk on and benches to sit on.

Finally, I like theme parks. These parks have lots of games, and shows.
They are colorful. There are many fun things to do and see.

When I visit the park, I start by walking along the paths.
I enjoy the fresh air and listening to the birds.
I see people jogging, riding bikes, and walking their dogs.
Kids play on the playground and laugh.

I like to sit on a bench and watch the ducks in the river.
Sometimes, I have a picnic with sandwiches and fruit.
Before I leave, I relax on the grass.
The park is a nice place to enjoy nature.

Last Saturday, I went to the Nature Park.
I arrived at 10 a.m. and started with a walk.
I saw people jogging and families having picnics.

I found a spot under a tree to read my book.
Later, I watched the ducks in the river and saw kids playing on the playground.
Around noon, I had a picnic with a sandwich and fruit.

Before leaving, I took a short nap under the tree.
I left the park at 2 p.m., feeling happy and refreshed.
