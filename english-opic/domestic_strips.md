### You indicated in the survey that you like to travel domestically. Tell me about some of the places you like to travel to and why you like going

I love traveling within my country, especially to Da Nang.
I enjoy its beautiful beaches like My Khe Beach and the lively city atmosphere.
Ba Na Hills, with its famous Golden Bridge, is also a highlight.

Another place I like is Da Lat. Itâ€™s cooler than other cities and surrounded by mountains and lakes, making it peaceful and relaxing.

Lastly, I love visiting Cat Ba Island. The island is famous for its landscapes, with clear waters, and beautiful beaches.
Exploring Cat Ba National Park and taking a boat tour around Lan Ha Bay make the experience unforgettable.
These places offer a great mix of relaxation and adventure.
