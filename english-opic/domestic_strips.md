### You indicated in the survey that you like to travel domestically. Tell me about some of the places you like to travel to and why you like going

I love traveling within my country, especially to Da Nang.
I enjoy its beautiful beaches like My Khe Beach and the lively city atmosphere.
Ba Na Hills, with its famous Golden Bridge, is also a highlight.

Another place I like is Da Lat. It’s cooler than other cities and surrounded by mountains and lakes, making it peaceful and relaxing.

Lastly, I love visiting Cat Ba Island. The island is famous for its landscapes, with clear waters, and beautiful beaches.
Discovering Cat Ba National Park and taking a boat tour around Lan Ha Bay make the experience unforgettable.

### Can you tell me about the things you do in order to prepare for trips

When I prepare for a trip, I start by making a checklist of essentials.
First, I plan my travel and book a hotel and transportation.
Then, I pack according to the destination's weather and activities.
For example, I bring comfortable clothes for walking, and swimwear for the beach.
I also pack important items like my ID, money, phone charger, and toiletries.
Before leaving, I double-check everything to make sure I haven’t forgotten anything.
Lastly, I research the local culture and attractions so I can make the most of my trip.

### Traveling can lead to many kinds of interesting, funny, and unexpected experiences. Tell me about one travel experience you had that was unforgettable. start by telling me when this happened, where you were, and who you were, and then, tell me, about all the things that happened that made this experience unforgettable

Last year, I visited Cat Ba Island with friends.
During a boat tour around Lan Ha Bay, the engine suddenly broke down, leaving us stranded.
Instead of panicking, we made the most of it by swimming in the clear water and watching local fishermen.
Eventually, another boat rescued us, but the unexpected adventure made the experience unforgettable.
What could have been a bad situation turned into one of the best memories of the trip.
