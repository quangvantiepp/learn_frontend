I love traveling within my country, especially to Da Nang.
I enjoy its beautiful beaches like My Khe Beach and the lively city atmosphere.
Ba Na Hills, with its famous Golden Bridge, is also a highlight.

Another place I like is Da Lat. It’s cooler than other cities and surrounded by mountains and lakes, making it peaceful and relaxing.

Lastly, I love visiting Cat Ba Island. The island is famous for its landscapes, with clear waters, and beautiful beaches.
Discovering Cat Ba National Park and taking a boat tour around Lan Ha Bay make the experience unforgettable.

### Can you tell me about the things you do in order to prepare for trips

When I prepare for a trip, I start by making a checklist of essentials.
First, I plan my travel and book a hotel and transportation.
Then, I pack according to the destination's weather and activities.
For example, I bring comfortable clothes for walking, and swimwear for the beach.
I also pack important items like my ID, money, phone charger, and toiletries.
Before leaving, I double-check everything to make sure I haven’t forgotten anything.
Lastly, I research the local culture and attractions so I can make the most of my trip.

Last summer, I went to Cat Ba Island with my friends.
We were excited to explore the island, so we took a boat tour around Lan Ha Bay.
Everything was going well until the boat suddenly stopped because the engine broke down.
At first, we were nervous, but then we decided to have fun.
We jumped into the water and swam while waiting for help.
And we saw many beautiful fish.
After some time, another boat came to help us.
Instead of being upset, we laughed and enjoyed the experience.
This adventure made the trip unforgettable because we turned a problem into a fun memory.
