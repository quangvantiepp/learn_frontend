### I would like to know where you live, can you describe your home to me? What does it look like how many rooms does it have?

I live in a poor village in Son La province in the north of Vietnam.
My house is a stilt house, all made of wood.
Because there are many wild animals, so this type of house is very suitable for my hometown.
The house has no rooms, and there are no partitions.
It is an open space arranged with a sleeping area and a dining area. A Between area for living, with TV everyone often watches movies together.
The toilet and bathroom will be built away far from the main house.
