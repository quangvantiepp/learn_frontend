### I would like to know where you live, can you describe your home to me? What does it look like how many rooms does it have?

I live in an apartment in the city.
It’s not very big, but it’s comfortable for me.
My home has two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, and a bathroom.
The living room is the largest room, with a sofa, a TV, and a small table.
The kitchen is next to the living room, and it’s where I cook.
My bedroom has a bed, a closet, and a desk where I study or work.
My home is simple, and I feel relaxed when I’m there.

### What is your normal routine at home? Do you do housework every day? What do you usually do on weekdays and what do you do on weekends?

During the week, I have a routine at home.
On weekdays, I usually wake up early around 7 a.m., have breakfast, and get ready for work.
After that, I spend most of the day working and studying.
When I come home in the evening, I usually relax by watching TV or reading a book.
Sometimes I cook dinner or order food if I’m tired.
I try to do some housework, like cleaning the kitchen, and bedroom, but I don’t do it every day.
On weekends, I like to spend time with my family or friends, maybe going out for lunch or just relaxing at home.
I also like to watch movies or play video games on the weekends.

### Describe the home you lived in as a child. How was it different from the home you live in now?

When I was a child, I lived in a house with my family.
It was bigger than the apartment I live in now.
The house had three bedrooms, a large living room, a kitchen, and a garden.
I remember spending a lot of time playing outside in the garden, especially in the summer.
My current apartment is smaller, and I don’t have a garden.
Also, my childhood home was in a quieter area, while now I live in a busy city.
