Last summer, I went to Cat Ba Island with my friend.
We were excited to explore the island, so we took a boat tour around Lan Ha Bay.
Everything was going well until the boat suddenly stopped because the engine broke down.
At first, we were nervous, but then we decided to have fun.
We jumped into the water, swam in the clear water, and saw many beautiful fish swimming around us.
After some time, another boat came to help us.
Instead of being upset, we laughed and enjoyed the experience.
This adventure made the trip unforgettable because we turned a problem into a fun memory.

We took a boat around Lan Ha Bay, and I saw many beautiful mountains rising from the clear water and with many beautiful fish.
We also went to Cat Ba National Park, where we walked through the forest and saw different kinds of animals and plants.

We spent a lot of time swimming and relaxing on the beach.
I remember feeling so happy being surrounded by nature.
That trip to Cat Ba Island is still one of my favorite childhood memories.
