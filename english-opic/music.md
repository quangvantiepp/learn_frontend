### 1. MUSIC

### 1.1 What kinds of music do you listen to? Who are some of your favorite musicians or composers?

I listen to many kinds of music. Depending on my mood or activity.
Sometimes, I enjoy listening to pop music because it’s fun and makes me feel happy.
I also like EDM when I need more energy, especially when I exercise or feel like dancing.
When I miss my family or my hometown, I prefer classical or country music because it feels relaxing and comforting.

Some of my favorite musicians are very popular.
I really like Taylor Swift because she’s beautiful, her songs are catchy, and they tell great stories.
Another musician I like is Ed Sheeran.
He’s very talented, and his music is full of emotion. He’s also a great live performer.
Each artist and type of music gives me different emotions and brings back special memories.

### 1.2 When and where do you usually go to listen to music? Do you listen to the radio? Do you go to concerts? Tell me about the different ways you enjoy music.

I listen to music almost every day, and I usually do it when I’m commuting, working, or relaxing at home.

For example, when I take the bus to work, I like to wear my earphones and play soft pop music or lo-fi beats. It helps me start the day in a better mood.

At work, I sometimes listen to instrumental music to help me focus. At night, I enjoy playing music on my speaker while lying on my bed.

I don’t listen to the radio very often, but sometimes when I’m in a taxi or a coffee shop, I hear music from the radio. It’s a fun way to discover new songs.

As for concerts, I haven’t been to many, but I went to one last year with my friends. The atmosphere was exciting, and hearing live music felt very special.

Overall, I enjoy music in different ways depending on my mood, location, and what I’m doing.

### 1.3 When did you first become interested in music? What kinds of music did you like at first? Tell me how your interest in music developed from your childhood until today

I think I became interested in music when I was a child.

When I was in elementary school, my parents used to play Vietnamese folk songs and soft ballads at home. 
I didn’t understand the lyrics much, but I liked the melodies. That was the first time I felt connected to music.

Later, in middle school, I started listening to pop songs by Vietnamese singers like Son Tung M-TP. 
At that time, I liked music that was fun and easy to sing along with. 
I would often share songs with my friends and talk about our favorite artists.

In high school and university, my taste in music changed. 
I started enjoying English songs, especially from artists like Ed Sheeran or Taylor Swift. 
Their songs helped me learn English and understand different cultures.

Now, I listen to many types of music depending on my mood, like EDM for energy or piano music for focus. 
Music has become a big part of my life, and I can't imagine a day without it.

### 1.4 Could you think back to a particularly memorable time when you heard live music? When was it? Where were you? Who were you with? What happened that performance so memorable?

One of the most memorable times I heard live music was last year, at a concert in Hanoi.

It was a music festival held outdoors, and I went there with two of my close friends. 
We were all very excited because our favorite artist, Son Tung M-TP, was performing.

The atmosphere was amazing — there were lights, big speakers, and thousands of people cheering. 
When he came on stage, everyone screamed and sang along. I remember feeling so happy and full of energy.

What made it special was that it was my first live concert ever. 
I had only seen him on YouTube before, so watching him perform in person was a completely different experience.

We stayed until the end, and even though it rained a little, we didn’t care. After the show, we talked about it for days.

That night made me realize how powerful live music can be. I still think about it whenever I hear his songs.
